ANNPoolPlayer
===============

The objective of this research was to investigate the
possibility of using Neural Networks to create
artificial pool players that solve the game in the same
way that humans would. In the base of the learning
algorithm is positive and negative reinforcement on a
back-propagation learning neural network. The
study showed what the most appropriate format for
representing the table is and how to create and
interpret the output of the network. It highlights the
main problems of the system such as foul-turns and
oscillations into local minima and gives solutions to
counteract them.
